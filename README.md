# AoC 2024 in Haskell

Second time trying AoC. Last time, tapped out at Day 15. Let's see how far I go this time?

## To run

1. Get GHC and Cabal. Best way to do this is to install GHCup:

```
> brew install ghcup
```

1. Modify the inputs in the respective files. They are named `day{day-number}input.txt`.

2. Build the exe:

```
> cabal build && cabal install
```

3. Run it:

```
> aoc2024
```

This will prompt you to enter the day for which you want to run the solutions:

```
> aoc2024
Day?
```

Enter the number and it gives you the results:

```
> aoc2024
Day? 1
part1: ...
part2: ...
```
